### Adapter Design Pattern Summary

The Adapter design pattern is a structural pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between two incompatible interfaces by wrapping an existing class with a new interface expected by the client. This pattern is useful when integrating legacy or third-party code with new systems.

#### Key Concepts

- **Target**: The interface expected by the client.
- **Adaptee**: The existing class with an incompatible interface.
- **Adapter**: The class that implements the target interface and translates requests to the adaptee.

### Real-Life Examples and Use Cases for the Adapter Pattern

- **Legacy System Integration**: Adapting old APIs or classes to work with new code without modifying the legacy code.
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Wrapping third-party interfaces so they can be used with your application's expected interface.
- **Device Drivers**: Adapters allow operating systems to communicate with hardware devices using a standard interface, regardless of device-specific protocols.
- **Payment Gateways**: Adapters enable applications to interact with multiple payment providers through a unified interface.
- **Data Format Conversion**: Adapting data from one format (e.g., XML) to another (e.g., JSON) for compatibility between systems.

These examples illustrate how the Adapter pattern enables interoperability between components with different interfaces, promoting code reuse and flexibility.
