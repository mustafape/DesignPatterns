The Composite design pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. It enables clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to work with recursive structures, such as graphical scenes, file systems, or organizational hierarchies.

#### Key Concepts

- **Component**: The base interface or abstract class for all objects in the composition, both simple and complex.
- **Leaf**: Represents simple objects in the composition that do not have children.
- **Composite**: Represents complex objects that may have children (other leaf or composite objects). Implements child-related operations.

### Real-Life Examples and Use Cases for the Composite Pattern

- **Graphic Editors**: In applications like vector graphic editors, shapes (lines, circles, rectangles) can be grouped into complex shapes. Both simple shapes and groups can be manipulated uniformly (move, resize, delete).
- **File Systems**: Directories (composites) can contain files (leaves) or other directories. Operations like listing contents or calculating size can be performed on both files and directories in a uniform way.
- **GUI Frameworks**: User interface components such as panels (composites) can contain buttons, text fields, or other panels. Actions like rendering or event handling are applied uniformly to all components.
- **Organization Hierarchies**: Employees (leaves) and managers (composites) in a company structure. Both can be treated as "employees" for operations like calculating total salaries or sending notifications.
- **Document Structures**: In document editors, documents are composed of elements like paragraphs, tables, and images. These elements can themselves contain other elements, allowing uniform processing (e.g., rendering, exporting).

These examples illustrate how the Composite pattern simplifies working with complex, hierarchical structures by treating individual and composite objects uniformly.
